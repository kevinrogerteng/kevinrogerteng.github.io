  <p> <img class="picofme" src="public/images/face1.png" align="left" /> Welcome to my kingdom!... I mean, hi there! I'm Kevin Roger Teng, you can call me Kevin for short. I'm a full stack web developer with a degree in Business Management.</p><br>
  <p>Prior to being a full stack web developer, I was working as a customer support representative for three years. Everyday was routinary, which was completely fine, but being barked at for almost 40 hours in a week and making angry people happy got a bit tiring. I have then decided to change my career path and immersed myself into General Assembly's Web Development Program. </p><br>
  <p>It was an amazing 12 week experience and I have developed a passion for technology. I also realized that programming is a craft, a discpline and an art. </p>
  <p> Given my work experience and the skills I've learned in GA, I have a very good understanding of process flow and process improvement which is a addon in web development. I also have a very good grasp in debugging and providing simple solutions to complex problems.</p>
  <p> I am currently a huge fan of Angular JS and Rails. I am working to be more in depth with the two frameworks.</p>

          <h3> Locally</h3>
          <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong> Travel and be a local! Locally is a web application that maintains and provides suggestions of places to eat and visit based on your destination.</p>
          <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong> I used to travel a lot and I'm such a huge foodie. I get many suggestions from my friends of places to eat and visit. It's no fun opening your email or notebook to keep track of the places you want to go and/or have been. I decided to apply this problem as my first project at General Assembly.</p>
          <p class="description"><strong> Technologies: </strong> Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Yelp Api, HTML5, CSS3 <p>
          <p class="description"><strong> What's next? </strong> Version 2 using Angular JS</p>

          <h3> Grokkie </h3>
          <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong> Grokkie is a web application to help users remember and share the resources they have used to 'grok' (or in other words, truly understand) a certain subject. A collection of these resources is known as a 'Roadmap.' Roadmaps are a clear route to grokking a certain skill, with each resource being a stop along the way. Grokkie was a group project and developed by 4 individuals.</p>
          <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong> One thing we did NOT have in common as a group was our different learning styles, some of us preferred to learn on our own by reading various articles on programmers while others prefer watching youtube videos and coding along. We wanted to share our knowledge of learning Ruby, Rails and Javascript using various resources and approaches (that we think is best).</p>

          <h3> Feedback First</h3>
          <p class="description"><strong> Description: </strong> Feedback First is an API built for an existing customer support application. Feedback First allows you to create reports or posts based on tags on customer feedback, this creates a more meaningful and supported stand when requesting to add or improve an app feature.</p>
          <p class="description"><strong> Inspiration: </strong> While I was working as a Customer Service Representative, I noticed how isolated our department is in terms of interactivity and involvement. I wanted to make the Support department more involved with the Product Management department's decision in adding or improving a new feature by making use of customer feedback. </p>
